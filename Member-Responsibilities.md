### Introduction

These aren't absolute rules, and nobody is going to get into trouble for not managing to do everything that is expected of their position: we're all here because we want to help out when we can, it's not serious business.

### Masterlist Maintainers

For the game(s) which masterlist(s) you maintain:

* Consider and make any changes suggested on the forum thread or by PM (discuss the changes first if you think it is warranted).
* Create a new thread whenever the current one reaches its 200 post limit. See [[Thread Management|Thread-Management]] for instructions.

With BOSS v3's release, there will be two versions of the masterlists existing in parallel. The v2 masterlists will be officially unmaintained, but if you want to make changes to them, you're welcome to do so (though you might need to get permissions for the Google Code repository, if you're a newer member). 

### Admins

When discussions on policy or particular changes stalemate, you get to make a decision on the result. That doesn't mean people will listen, of course... :P It's always good to try to reach consensus, and other admins can also make a different decision, so you might still have to argue it over with them.

You're also a more visible contact point for people with queries about BOSS, people may send you PMs with changes too. Just answer queries as best you can, or forward them on to those who you think could answer them better, and either make changes/additions yourself or post them into the relevant BOSS thread for the regular maintainers to process.

You're also in charge of managing the membership, which means:

* 'Hiring' new members if people contact you expressing an interest in helping out. You should exercise some judgement here, looking at their forum post history and at any released mods will generally tell you quite a lot about their level of experience and how helpful/active they are. New members will need to get set up on GitHub, ask WrinklyNinja if you're not sure how to do that.
* Resolving any disputes that might come up, ie. play mediator. Basically just try to avoid things getting blown out of all proportion. It hasn't happened yet...
* Removing any inactive members. As per our Membership Removal policy, check once a month and send emails to anyone removed.
* Removing any members that aren't being good team players. This should always be discussed with the other admins and/or their fellow masterlist maintainers first, and is a "last resort" action. Try to talk it over with the 'problem' member first.
