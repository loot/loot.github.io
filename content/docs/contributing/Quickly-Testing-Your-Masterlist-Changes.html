<p>You can easily test your masterlist changes <em>before</em> syncing them to the online repository, using the method detailed below, which makes LOOT use a local masterlist of your choosing rather than the online one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run LOOT, open the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Settings...</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the game you want to test and, in the <b>Masterlist Source</b> field, enter the path to your local masterlist. E.g., if you have the Skyrim masterlist in a repository at <code>C:\foo\bar\skyrim\masterlist.yaml</code>, then put that in the field.</li>
  <li>Save your settings, and the settings dialog will automatically close. LOOT will now update using your local masterlist instead of the online one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that LOOT won't keep your local masterlist synced with the online one, so you'll have to do that yourself.</p>
