<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This page is aimed at anyone who finds themselves in the position of being the only person active when a thread reaches its 200 post limit.</p>

<p>When a thread nears 200 posts, a new thread should be opened with the title <code>[REL] LOOT - Thread #&lt;num&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;num&gt;</code> is the number of the current thread + 1. The content of the opening post is given below.</p>

<p>Once the new thread has been created, it should be linked to in the current thread. The link on the LOOT website should also be updated, by editing the two links at the top of the website's <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot.github.io/blob/master/latest-thread.html">latest-thread.html file</a>.</p>

<h3>The Opening Post</h3>

<p>The contents of the box below can be copy/pasted when creating a new thread. Make sure to add the last thread to the bottom of the thread list whenever a new thread is created.</p>

<pre><code>[size=8]LOOT[/size]

A plugin load order optimiser for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.

[size=5]Introduction[/size]

Setting the right load order for your mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors such as incompatibilities and missing requirements, and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

[size=5]Downloads[/size]

LOOT can be downloaded from its [url=http://loot.github.io]website[/url]. Unstable snapshot builds may also be availableÂ [url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scuvwwc6ovzagmd/AAD1TodBAwGQTuV1-4Z2d0sCa?dl=0]here[/url].
