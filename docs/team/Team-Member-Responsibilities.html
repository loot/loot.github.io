title: Team Member Responsibilities

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>These aren't absolute rules, and nobody is going to get into trouble for not managing to do everything that is expected of their position: we're all here because we want to help out when we can, it's not serious business.</p>

<h3>Masterlist Maintenance</h3>

<p>Masterlist maintenance involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Considering and making any changes suggested on the forum thread or by PM (discuss the changes first if you think it is warranted).</li>
  <li>Merging any pull requests which make changes you think are appropriate. If a pull request makes any inappropriate changes, discuss them with the author in the pull request's message thread.</li>
  <li>Create a new forum thread whenever the current one reaches its 200 post limit.
</ul>

<h3>Thread Management</h3>

<p>LOOT's forum thread has a 200 post limit, and a new thread must be created each time that limit is reached. See <a href="Thread-Management.html">Thread Management</a> for more information.</li>

<h3>Membership Management</h3>

<p>Team members who are admins on GitHub are responsible for adding new members. GitHub's excellent Forking feature allows people to contribute to repositories that they don't have write access to, and you should take full advantage of that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If someone who hasn't contributed on GitHub asks for addition to the team, politely refer them to the <a href="/docs/contributing/How-To-Contribute.html">How To Contribute</a> page, saying that they can contribute without being a team member.</li>
  <li>If someone who has contributed on GitHub asks for addition to the team, take a look at their contributions (on their user page, in the "Repositories contributed to" list) and see if their contributions have been accepted or not to decide whether or not to grant them access. If their most recent pull requests have been rejected, it may be better to reply with a polite "not until we're happy with your contributions" message.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add a GitHub user to the team, go to the LOOT organisation's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/loot/people">People page</a> and click the big green "Invite member" button, then enter their username in the search box displayed and select the correct match. If they accept the invitation, ask them to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/">publicize their membership</a>: they don't have to, but it helps people outside the team find members.</p>
