<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>These aren't absolute rules, and nobody is going to get into trouble for not managing to do everything that is expected of their position: we're all here because we want to help out when we can, it's not serious business.</p>
<h3 id="masterlist-maintainers">Masterlist Maintainers</h3>
<p>For the game(s) which masterlist(s) you maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider and make any changes suggested on the forum thread or by PM (discuss the changes first if you think it is warranted).</li>
<li>Merge any pull requests which make changes you think are appropriate. If a pull request makes any inappropriate changes, discuss them with the author in the pull request's message thread.</li>
<li>Create a new forum thread whenever the current one reaches its 200 post limit. See [[Thread Management|Thread-Management]] for instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="admins">Admins</h3>
<p>When discussions on policy or particular changes reach a stalemate, you get to make a decision on the result. That doesn't mean people will listen, of course... :P It's always good to try to reach consensus, and other admins can also make a different decision, so you might still have to argue it over with them.</p>
<p>You're also a more visible contact point for people with queries about LOOT, people may send you PMs with changes too. Just answer queries as best you can, or forward them on to those who you think could answer them better, and either make changes/additions yourself or post them into the relevant thread for the regular maintainers to process.</p>
<p>Finally, you're responsible for adding new members. GitHub's excellent Forking feature allows people to contribute to repositories that they don't have write access to, and you should take full advantage of that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If someone who hasn't contributed on GitHub asks for addition to the team, politely refer them to the [[How To Contribute|How-To-Contribute]] wiki page, saying that they can contribute without being a team member.</li>
<li>If someone who has contributed on GitHub asks for addition to the team, take a look at their contributions (on their user page, in the &quot;Repositories contributed to&quot; list) and see if their contributions have been accepted or not to decide whether or not to grant them access. If their most recent pull requests have been rejected, it may be better to reply with a polite &quot;not until we're happy with your contributions&quot; message.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a GitHub user to the team, go to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/loot/teams/looters">Looters team page</a> and click the &quot;Add member&quot; button, then enter their username in the search box displayed and select the correct match. Then, go to the [[Team Members|Team-Members]] wiki page and add their names to the list.</p>
