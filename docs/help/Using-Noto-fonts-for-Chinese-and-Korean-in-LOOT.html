title: Using Noto Fonts for Chinese and Korean in LOOT
---

<p><strong>Note: This information applies to very recent LOOT code. At time of writing, no release or build has been made available that includes the features described below.</strong></p>

<p>As of LOOT v0.7, translations exist for Simplified Chinese and Korean. LOOT supports the use of Google's Noto fonts for these languages, in order to provide a more pleasant reading experience. However, due to their size, they are not included in LOOT's installer or archive.</p>

<p>To use the Noto fonts with LOOT:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/family/noto-sans-hans">Simplified Chinese</a> and/or <a href="http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/family/noto-sans-kore">Korean</a> fonts from Google.</li>
  <li>Extract the downloaded archives and place the <code>*.otf</code> files they contain into your <code>%LOOT%/resources/report/fonts/</code> folder, where <code>%LOOT%</code> is LOOT's installation directory.</li>
  <li>If you have LOOT open, close and re-launch it. It will detect and load the Noto fonts.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also install the fonts by right-clicking them and choosing the "Install" option, or double-clicking them and clicking the "Install" button in the window that is opened, but LOOT may be unable to load fonts installed in this manner.</p>
