title: Quickly Testing Your Masterlist Changes
---

<p>You can easily test your masterlist changes <em>before</em> syncing them to the online repository, using the method detailed below, which makes LOOT use a local repository of your choosing than the online one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run LOOT, and open its settings window.</li>
  <li>Select the game whose masterlist you want to test, and click "Edit Game...".</li>
  <li>In the Masterlist Repository URL setting's text box, enter the path to your local repository. Eg. if you have the Skyrim masterlist repository at <code>C:\foo\bar\skyrim</code>, then put that in the box.</li>
  <li>Apply the settings, then close and relaunch LOOT. LOOT will now update using your local repository instead of the online one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that LOOT won't keep your local repository synced with the online one, so you'll have to do that yourself.</p>
