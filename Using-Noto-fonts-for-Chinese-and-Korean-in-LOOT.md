**Note: This information applies to very recent LOOT code. At time of writing, no release or build has been made available that includes the features described below.**

As of LOOT v0.7, translations exist for Simplified Chinese and Korean. LOOT supports the use of Google's Noto fonts for these languages, in order to provide a more pleasant reading experience. However, due to their size, they are not included in LOOT's installer or archive.

To use the Noto fonts with LOOT:

1. Download the [Simplified Chinese](http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/family/noto-sans-hans) and/or [Korean](http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/family/noto-sans-kore) fonts from Google.
2. Extract the downloaded archives and place the `*.otf` files they contain into your `%LOOT%/resources/report/fonts/` folder, where `%LOOT%` is LOOT's installation directory.
3. If you have LOOT open, close and re-launch it. It will detect and load the Noto fonts.

You can also install the fonts by right-clicking them and choosing the "Install" option, or double-clicking them and clicking the "Install" button in the window that is opened, but LOOT may be unable to load fonts installed in this manner.
