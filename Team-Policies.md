### Policies

As time goes by, we sometimes find it's good to have rules written down for things relating to how we operate. This is where we write these rules. Please don't change them without prior discussion.

#### Plugin Addition

It's pretty simple: if a plugin is, or will shortly be (eg. author giving heads-up about imminent release), publicly available for download, it is eligible for addition to the appropriate masterlist.

Plugins that are not available to the public are not suitable for inclusion in the masterlist - if someone reports such a plugin, tell them that it is more appropriate for them to add any necessary metadata using a userlist rule. Such cases include private beta plugins, or more generally plugins distributed amongst a select group of people, or plugins for which you have to pay to access (which is against Bethesda's rules, but has undoubtedly happened before).

#### Link Requesting

Sometimes it is necessary for a maintainer to download a plugin to investigate it, eg. to double-check information provided by a user. In such cases, we generally ask the user to provide a link to the plugin in question. However, because most submitting activity occurs on Bethesda's official forums, we have to abide by their rules. These rules include not linking to nude mods, for instance, and not discussing certain mods that break their rules (eg. Morroblivion).

If a user submits a plugin that falls into such a catagory and they provide a link, ask them to remove it, stating why. It's best not to draw negative moderator attention to the threads, because we need them to stay open. (Moderators are highly unlikely to lock the thread or get on to us about such cases, but better safe than sorry, plus you educate users that may have been unaware of the rules.)

If a user submits a plugin that falls into such a catagory and they don't provide a link, ask them to PM you a link to the plugin.

#### Membership Removal

This covers removing an individual from the team purely due to inactivity on their part. We haven't yet needed a policy for removing team members otherwise.

To avoid bloating the team membership, individuals can be removed from the team if they have made no contributions to the masterlists. There are two cases for this:

* If a newly-added member does not make any commits within the first month of their membership being awarded, they can be removed without credit.
* If a member does not make any commits within the most recent two calendar months (ie. it's not a rolling check, just once a month), they can be removed with credit.

In either case, an email should be sent to the member's given email address containing the following notification:

> You've been removed from the LOOT team membership according to our membership removal policy (see our Guidelines wiki page for details). If you wish to contribute again in future please contact a LOOT admin saying so and you will be reinstated.

For removal "with credit", this means that they remain credited as a LOOT team member, but are moved to the list of inactive members.

Member activity is most easily checked by scrolling back through the commit history and making a list of the authors displayed. Anyone not listed has been inactive.

Note: Admins are exempt from this policy, for a couple of reasons:

* They might be active, just not in masterlist maintenance.
* They act as safety-nets for the project, in case the active membership disappears. An otherwise inactive admin can step in and get the ball rolling again.
