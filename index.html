title: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
---

<p>Setting the right load order for your <strong>TES IV: Oblivion</strong>, <strong>TES V: Skyrim</strong>, <strong>TES V: Skyrim Special Edition</strong>, <strong>Fallout 3</strong>, <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong>, <strong>Fallout 4</strong> and <strong>Fallout 4 VR</strong> mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.</p>

<p>While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.</p>
