<h2>Load order optimisation for Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas</h2>

<p>Setting the right load order for your mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.</p>

<p>While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>There are currently two versions available for download: the latest stable release (v0.6.1), and the latest beta  (v0.7.0 beta 4). The stable release is recommended for most users, while those who don't mind running into the occasional issue can help test the beta.</p>
