loot.github.io
==============

This repository acts as the main LOOT team repository, and holds all the issues and wiki pages that aren't specific to the code or any one game. In addition to that, it also holds LOOT's static website.

The static website is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site that uses [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) components and the [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) library, which are provided by Google and Cloudflare CDNs respectively.

The site also depends on [Octokat.js](https://github.com/philschatz/octokat.js), which can be installed using [Bower](http://bower.io/) or just downloaded and extracted so that `bower_components/octokat/dist/octokat.js` exists from this repository's root.
