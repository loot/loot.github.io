==============

This repository acts as the main LOOT team repository, and holds all the issues that aren't specific to the code or any one game. In addition to that, it also holds LOOT's static website.

The static website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that uses [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/) components and the [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) and [Github.js](https://github.com/michael/github) libraries, which are provided by Google, Cloudflare and unpkg CDNs respectively.
