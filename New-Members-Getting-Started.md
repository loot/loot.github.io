First of all, thanks for volunteering to help develop/maintain BOSS! This page will guide you from having just volunteered all the way through to getting set up and making your first contribution.

### Installing a Git Client

BOSS uses Git as its revision control system, which helps manage all the changes made to its files by the BOSS team members. As such, you'll need a Git client to work with the BOSS repositories. Any client should do, but here are three you might want to try out if you don't already have a preference:

* [Official Client](http://git-scm.com/downloads) - Plain, but functional application.
* [Git-Cola](http://git-cola.github.io/) - Like the official client, but prettier and more intuitive to use. Has additional dependencies though.
* [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) - Instead of being an application in a single window, this uses context menu items and icon overlays in Windows Explorer to provide a GUI for Git.

### Registering on GitHub

Since they're hosted on GitHub, you need a GitHub account to work with the BOSS repositories. Sign up for one then send the BOSS team admin you initially contacted your GitHub username. Also tell them what you want to work on since the code, the site and each of the games' masterlists all have separate repositories with different access permissions.

### Setting Up Git

See GitHub's own [getting started guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). On Windows, it's probably easier to use HTTPS with password caching than OpenSSH for authentication, but either will work.
