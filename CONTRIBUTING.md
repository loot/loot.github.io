Contributing To LOOT
====================

## Filing Issues

An issue should only be filed in the loot.github.io repository's issue tracker if it:

* relates to the [loot.github.io](http://loot.github.io) website.
* is an issue affecting several masterlists.
* affects the LOOT project or team as a whole.
* is too general or vague to be filed in a more specific repository.

Otherwise, an issue should be filed elsewhere. Please see [How To Report Issues Helpfully](https://loot.github.io/docs/help/How-To-Report-Issues-Helpfully.html) for information on doing so.
